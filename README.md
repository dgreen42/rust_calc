# Rust Calculator

This is a calculator that can perform equations that have multiple terms. This project is a exploration into parsing. An equation with multiple parts needs to be able to fingure out which terms must be evaluated first. In order to do this the equation must be parsed and the evaluated. This was originally written in C, however, I was getting too many segfaults. I am more comfortable writing Rust anyways.
